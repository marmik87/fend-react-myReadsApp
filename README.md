# MyReads Project
This is the project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course in Front-End Developer Nanodegree. It was created by template provided by Udacity (where the app was bootstrapped with Create React App). Students were given just plain starting files, CSS styling, with no functionality.

## To run this app:
1. clone/download the files to your computer;
2. install all project dependencies with npm install;
3. start the development server with npm start (the app will be running at localhost:3000).

## Backend Server
Backend server was fully provided by Udacity. See BooksApi.js for more info and see the methods used in the app.
